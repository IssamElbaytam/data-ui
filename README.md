# data-ui

`data-ui` is a collection of modules & documentation of approaches for editing & managing data through user interfaces.

## The goal

Create a set of open source js, css, & html packages that provide accessible, easy-to-use tools related to editing & managing various kinds of data sets & data types.

## Objectives

- Document current approaches to providing interfaces for editing loosely-structured data
- Mockup, prototype, & user test a wide range of approaches to editing, validating, & organizing data through a user interface
- Build npm packages for the approaches that best address problems
- Use the npm packages to build editors for projects like [dat](http://github.com/maxogden/dat) & [flatsheet](http://github.com/flatsheet), content management systems, etc.

## Focus areas include:

- tabular grid editing
- interfaces for editing loosely structured data that are _not_ a spreadsheet-like grid, possibly including:
  - a blog admin-style interface
  - a streamlined ui similar to inbox.google.com
  - interactive input similar to slack's onboarding prompts
- activity stream & notifications about changes to data sets
- revision history & showing diffs of changes
- automating population of additional fields based on input in one field
- input helpers for various data types
- data validation ui helpers
- team production/editorial workflows for data sets
- ordering & filtering data
- realtime editing

## See also

There are a number of existing projects related to editing JSON & tabular data.

We're documenting those projects & approaches in the [resources.md](resources.md) file, and contributions are welcome!
