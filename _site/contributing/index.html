<h1>Conduct</h1>

<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
or similar personal characteristic.</p>

<p>On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</p>

<p>Please be kind and courteous. There&#39;s no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.</p>

<p>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</p>

<p>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term &quot;harassment&quot; as
including the definition in the
<a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>;
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don&#39;t tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</p>

<p>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the core team
immediately. Whether you&#39;re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about
making this community a safe place for you and we&#39;ve got your back.</p>

<p>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.</p>

<h1>Communication</h1>

<p>GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.</p>

<p>In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues
are often contentious and we&#39;d like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused
on what we&#39;re actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.</p>
